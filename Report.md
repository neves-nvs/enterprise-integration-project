# Report Enterprise Integration Project - Sprint 2

<!-- TODO -->

In this report, we will test all microservices to assess the effectiveness of their methods by accessing each virtual machine. We will utilize Swagger-UI flags to correspond with each service, enabling thorough examination of their functionalities.

Terraform will be used to deploy the whole infrastructure directly. Given that we only need to run the following commands to deploy the whole infrastructure:

```bash
cd Terraform
Terraform init
Terraform apply --auto-approve
```

---

In need to destroy just a part of the infrastructure, now that everything is coupled under a single terraform, we must leverage terraform destroy in a more granular way.

If you have access to `fzf`, you can use the following script to destroy a specific resource:

> Be careful to not destroy a resource that is being used by another resource, as they may not be able to recover (this is recommended to destroy microservices and kong/konga)

```bash
terraform destroy -target=$(terraform state list | fzf)
```

if you don't have `fzf`, you can use the following script to destroy a specific resource:

```bash
terraform state list
# copy the resource you want to destroy
terraform destroy -target=<resource>
```
